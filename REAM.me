Todo task manager

Todo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

It allows the user to:
- add tasks
- mark tasks as done by clicking on them
- sort tasks (A-Z)

The app uses: 

An array in JavaScript to store tasks, 
A render function to update the task list every time a change occurs.
I also used inline CSS to show completed tasks with a line-through.
